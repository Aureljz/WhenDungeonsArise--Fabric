# When Dungeons Arise - Fabric
Elegant -and likely hostile- roguelike dungeons and structures that generate on your worlds!

This mod adds **30+ new structures**, focusing on imposing builds and catchy colours.

More information, as well as screenshots of most structures, can be found on our [Curseforge Project](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/when-dungeons-arise).

## Credits

While most original structures from this mod were built by Aurelj, DiamondTown and Zephyrusj, we'd love to thank MercyWhistles and Wyll_ for letting us include some of their structures too.

[TelephaticGrunt's Structure Tutorial](https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/StructureTutorialMod) was used as a reference for internal parts of the mod. This is an awesome modding tutorial and we wouldn't have been able to create this mod without some help.

Their licence at the time of writing this is included on #licence.txt.
